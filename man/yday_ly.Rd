\description{
Find the day of year for a date, where the leap day of Feb 29 is considered to have the same value as Feb 28.
}
\details{
This is useful when analysing data across the day of year dimension, as it avoids a day offset of 1 for leap years.
Calculating aggregates based on the output of this function will group Feb 28 and Feb 29 together.
Any days after this will always have the same day of year value.

i.e., a value of 365 is always Dec 31, rather than Dec 31 on non leap years, and Dec 30 on leap years.
